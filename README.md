## About Me

Located in the South West of England.

Currently in my second year of college for my Maths, Further Maths, Computer Science and Physics A-levels.

I use Arch Linux and Neovim btw.

## Interests

Low level development.

Gaming (games such as Satisfactory, Terraria and KSP).

## Active projects

Using LaTeX to create a document about the major features of the x86 architecture (such as assembly, cache (and MESI), paging and segmentation) and coding programs such as 'cat' in assembly.

Using Rust to create a secure messaging/chat application for my Computer Science NEA, and using LaTeX to document it.

Using Rust and WGPU to create an automation/factory game (started around March 2024).

## Languages

Language|Fluency
-|-
Rust|Very fluent in it
LaTeX|Used it to create large PDFs, relatively fluent
Bash|Have created many scripts in it
Wgsl|Have created many simple shaders
Python|Use it for some school work (but dislike it)
Lua|Use it for Neovim config
C/C++|Have a limited experience of C but am learning it
C#|Have a lot of experience in it but haven't used it recently

## Journey

Started programming python in mid-2021.
Started using Unreal Engine to create 'games' around April 2022.
Switched to using Godot (with C#) around May 2023.
Switched to learning Rust to create games in September 2023.
Started using Linux Mint in September 2024, and started using Git, Neovim and LaTeX soon after.
Switched fully to using Linux Mint in March 2025 then Arch a Month later (where I started scripting using Bash).
Began the x86 architecture project where I started learning assembly and some C (to help with understanding the layout of some structs such as stat defined in header files).
